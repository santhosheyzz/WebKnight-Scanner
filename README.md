# 🛡️ WebKnight-Scanner (Web Application Vulnerability Scanner)

This project is part of my cybersecurity journey, focused on building a **custom Python-based vulnerability scanner** that detects common web application flaws like **XSS**, **SQL Injection**, and **CSRF**, following the **OWASP Top 10** standards.
